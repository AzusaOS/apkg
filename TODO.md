# Stuff to do in the future

* Remove old inode allocations upon db update so data can be freed
* Optimize stuff
* When doing update, make sure new version is actually newer, and reject if not
* Improve the new web API
* Implement check against hash table upon block access on packages
* Upgrade without restart (by passing fuse fd to child process)
